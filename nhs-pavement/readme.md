# [Percentage of NHS Pavement in Poor Condition](https://www.cmap.illinois.gov/2050/indicators/nhs-pavement)

Maintaining the existing transportation network and improving state of good repair are substantive priorities of ON TO 2050. Ride quality provides a good measure of user experience of the facility, and is also an indicator of the region’s level of reinvestment in existing infrastructure. This indicator measures the percentage of National Highway System (NHS) lane miles in the region that have “poor” ride quality. The NHS used for this analysis is the one defined in MAP-21 (Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century), the current federal surface transportation act.
