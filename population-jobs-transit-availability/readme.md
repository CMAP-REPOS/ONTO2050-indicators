# [Population and Jobs with at Least Moderately High Transit Availability](https://www.cmap.illinois.gov/2050/indicators/population-jobs-transit-availability)

This indicator will report the percentage of population and jobs with at least "moderately high" transit availability. This classification is based on CMAP's [Transit Availability Index](https://datahub.cmap.illinois.gov/dataset/access-to-transit-index) that considers multiple factors: proximity to transit stops, frequency of service, destinations reachable without a transfer, and walkability. For a specific area, this index is intended to measure the relative level of access residents and workers have to the transit system, regardless of their actual choice of mode.
