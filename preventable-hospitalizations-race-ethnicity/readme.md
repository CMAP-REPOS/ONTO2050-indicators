# [Preventable Hospitalizations by Race and Ethnicity](https://www.cmap.illinois.gov/2050/indicators/preventable-hospitalizations-race-ethnicity)

This indicator measures the number of preventable hospitalizations in the Chicago metropolitan area by race and ethnicity. A lower rate of preventable hospitalizations provides an indication of a healthier population that is receiving sufficient preventive care so that common, treatable conditions are addressed (by changes to medication, lifestyle, etc.) before becoming severe enough to warrant hospitalization.

CMAP is still in the process of obtaining the necessary data to calculate a baseline value for this indicator.
