# [Workforce Participation](https://www.cmap.illinois.gov/2050/indicators/workforce-participation)

This indicator tracks the percentage of the regional population (age 20-64) that is either working or actively looking for work. An increase in workforce participation is generally viewed as a positive indicator of regional economic opportunity. Increased participation suggests a decrease in the number of discouraged workers -- individuals who are able to work but currently unemployed, and who have not searched for employment in the last four weeks due to a lack of suitable options or a lack of success through previous job applications.

However, workforce participation is a complex measure because it tracks both the number of employed persons and unemployed persons currently looking for work. Thus an increase in unemployment can register as an increase in workforce participation. Similarly, decreases in workforce participation may be due to an increase in the number of discouraged job seekers, or to an increase in the number of people choosing to retire early or leave the workforce for other reasons. Even with these caveats, an increase in workforce participation is generally indicative of a healthy economy.

# [Workforce Participation by Race and Ethnicity](https://www.cmap.illinois.gov/2050/indicators/workforce-participation#InclusiveGrowth)

As a kindred indicator, ON TO 2050 also will track the share of the population in the Chicago metropolitan statistical area age 16 years and over that is either working or actively looking for work by race and ethnicity. Demographic groups participate in the workforce at differing rates. Black residents participate in the workforce at significantly lower rates than residents of other races or ethnicities.
