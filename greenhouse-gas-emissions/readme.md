# [Greenhouse Gas Emissions](https://www.cmap.illinois.gov/2050/indicators/greenhouse-gas-emissions)

This indicator measures the total amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions produced in the CMAP region. GHG emissions are calculated using the International Council for Local Environment Initiatives (ICLEI) Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventories (GPC) BASIC methodology, which includes all emission from buildings, solid waste, wastewater, and intraregional transportation. Emissions are reported in million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMTCO<sub>2</sub>e).
