# [Average Congested Hours of Weekday Travel for Limited Access Highways](https://www.cmap.illinois.gov/2050/indicators/highway-congestion-hours)

Congestion has negative effects on the regional economy (in terms of wasted time) and air quality (in terms of additional emissions). This indicator measures how long the region’s expressways are congested during weekday travel on average. “Congested hours” is defined as the number of hours each weekday that travelers could travel at least 10 percent faster in free-flow conditions.
