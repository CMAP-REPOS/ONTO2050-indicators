# [Percentage of Roadway Bridge Area in “Poor” Condition](https://www.cmap.illinois.gov/2050/indicators/nhs-bridges)

Like pavement condition, tracking bridge condition helps measure the region’s progress on improving the existing transportation system. This indicator measures the percentage of bridge deck area that are in “poor” condition. While a “poor” classification is the lowest condition rating for a bridge, it should be noted that it does not necessarily mean that a specific bridge is unsafe.
