# [Number of Intersections with Transit Priority or Queue Jumping](https://www.cmap.illinois.gov/2050/indicators/traffic-signals)

Road infrastructure and technology affect the speed, frequency, and reliability of transit ridership, but lie outside the control of the transit agencies themselves. Closer partnerships between transit and agencies responsible for roadways hold promise to create integrated, multimodal corridors. These approaches support transit ridership at relatively modest cost. This indicator tracks the implementation of projects that give priority to transit service.

Transit Signal Priority (TSP) utilizes vehicle location and wireless communication technologies to advance or extend green times at signalized intersections. This can help reduce bus travel times, improve schedule adherence, and reduce operating costs. TSP is also an important component of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and Arterial Rapid Transit (ART) projects. Queue jumps can work in conjunction with TSP or on their own to allow a bus to go through an intersection ahead of other vehicles.
