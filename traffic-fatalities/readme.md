# [Number of Traffic Fatalities](https://www.cmap.illinois.gov/2050/indicators/traffic-fatalities)

Ensuring a safer transportation system – for all modes – is a growing priority for the nation and region. ON TO 2050 offers strategies to improve safety for drivers, bicyclists, and pedestrians. To track progress, this measure tracks the five-year rolling average of the number of fatalities in the CMAP region on all public roads. This includes all motor vehicle fatalities and any pedestrians and cyclists involved. After declining for several decades, traffic fatality rates began increasing again in 2010, likely due to a combination of increased driving during the economic recovery and the rise of distracted driving fueled by smartphone usage.
