# [Population and Jobs in Highly Walkable Areas](https://www.cmap.illinois.gov/2050/indicators/walkable-areas)

ON TO 2050 places a high priority on supporting development of compact, walkable communities to help meet increasing demand for these places, support transit, and improve mobility. This indicator will report the percentages of the region’s population and jobs located in areas with “high” or “very high” walkability. To assess walkability, CMAP created [an index](https://www.cmap.illinois.gov/2050/maps/walkability) that considers multiple factors contributing to walkability: sidewalk coverage, nearby amenities, block length, intersection density, population and employment densities, tree canopy cover, and bicycle or pedestrian fatalities and serious injuries.
