# [Local Governments That Train Appointed Board Members](https://www.cmap.illinois.gov/2050/indicators/board-member-training)

This indicator tracks the percentage of local governments whose appointed board members with development review authority have recently completed relevant professional development training. The indicator includes not only plan commission and zoning board members, but also other boards charged with development review such as Historic Preservation and Environment Committees.

Strategy development for ON TO 2050 indicated that appointed board members, as well as government staff and elected officials, who regularly engage in trainings are more familiar with best practices and better prepared to fulfill their roles in service of their communities.
