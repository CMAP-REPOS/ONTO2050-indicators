# [Gini Coefficient](https://www.cmap.illinois.gov/2050/indicators/income-inequality)

This indicator summarizes income inequality in the Chicago region. The Gini coefficient measures the dispersion of income across the income distribution in the Chicago metropolitan statistical area (MSA). The Gini coefficient is measured between 0 to 1, representing perfect equality and perfect inequality, respectively. Broad-based growth can facilitate economic mobility and help decrease inequality. Increasing economic equity can increase both individual prosperity and regional growth, developing periods of economic growth that are stronger and more sustainable.
