# [Acres of Impervious Area](https://www.cmap.illinois.gov/2050/indicators/impervious-area)

This indicator measures the total number of acres of impervious surfaces in the region; it is the entire amount of hard surface (such as buildings, sidewalks and streets) in the landscape. Imperviousness is an important environmental indicator because it is negatively associated with various measures of the biological health and physical integrity of surface waters.
