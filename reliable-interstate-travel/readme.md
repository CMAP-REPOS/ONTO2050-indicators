# [Percentage of Person-Miles Traveled on the Interstate System with Reliable Travel Time](https://www.cmap.illinois.gov/2050/indicators/reliable-interstate-travel)

Unreliable travel times on these critical roads requires their users to budget extra time to ensure they arrive at their destinations on time. This increases commutes, limits movement of goods, and otherwise reduces quality of life and economic efficiency. The Level of Travel Time Reliability (LOTTR) is defined as the ratio of the longer travel times (80th percentile) to a “normal” travel time (50th percentile), with a ratio of less than 1.5 being considered "reliable." The measure is the percentage of person-miles traveled on the region’s Interstate system that meet this definition of reliability. Using person-miles rather than vehicle-miles gives equal weight to all individuals using the roads.
