# [Annual Unlinked Transit Trips](https://www.cmap.illinois.gov/2050/indicators/unlinked-transit-trips)

This indicator tracks the total number of annual unlinked transit trips. Trips are “unlinked” in that this is a total count of boardings, so that an individual making one transfer is counted as two unlinked trips. Increased transit ridership reduces greenhouse gas emissions, reduces roadway congestion, and improves air quality.
