# [Venture Capital Funding](https://www.cmap.illinois.gov/2050/indicators/venture-capital-funding)

This indicator measures the State of Illinois’ share of total U.S. venture capital deals. Innovation in new goods, services, processes, and technologies drives economic growth. Some of these innovations reach the commercial market through new business startups. These newly created firms can face substantial costs for researching, developing, and marketing new products or services. In these instances, investors can support high-risk, potentially high-growth startup companies through venture capital funding. Venture capital therefore plays an important role in the business startup process by providing support to businesses before they are financially sustainable or able to access traditional funding streams. Such investments tend to finance innovative ideas and companies in high-growth sectors.
