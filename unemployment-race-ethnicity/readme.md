# [Unemployment by Race and Ethnicity](https://www.cmap.illinois.gov/2050/indicators/unemployment-race-ethnicity)

This indicator tracks unemployment rates for the population age 16 years and over in the Chicago metropolitan statistical area by race and ethnicity. Unemployed residents are not currently well connected to opportunities provided by the region’s economy, and—as a result—a substantial portion of the region’s human capital is untapped. Creating pathways for unemployed workers to fully contribute to and benefit from the regional economy will help it grow to individual and regional benefit.
