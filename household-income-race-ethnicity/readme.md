# [Median Household Income by Race and Ethnicity](https://www.cmap.illinois.gov/2050/indicators/household-income-race-ethnicity)

This indicator measures median household income by race and ethnicity in the Chicago metropolitan statistical area (in 2016 inflation-adjusted dollars). Median household income reflects the economic well-being of a region’s population and highlights the hardships that impede residents of color from sharing in regional prosperity. This data highlights an existing need for collaborative efforts on inclusive growth that promote economic opportunity, particularly for the region’s black and Hispanic households. Economic and workforce development efforts must meet the needs of a changing and diversifying economy, and promote growth of and access to jobs with pathways for upward mobility.

**Note about 2020 data:** Due to data quality concerns arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Census Bureau will not publish 1-year ACS summary tables for 2020. To obtain a 2020 estimate, CMAP instead used the [2020 ACS 1-Year Public Use Microdata Sample with Experimental Weights](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/experimental-data/2020-1-year-pums.html). Since this data is only available for Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs), the 2020 estimate represents the closest possible approximation of the Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, IL-IN-WI Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA): the Illinois and Wisconsin portions are accurately represented, but the Indiana counties of Jasper and Newton were omitted because they share a PUMA with the slightly more populous counties of Fulton, Pulaski and Starke, which are not part of the MSA.
