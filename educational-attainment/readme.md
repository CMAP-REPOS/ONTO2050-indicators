# [Educational Attainment](https://www.cmap.illinois.gov/2050/indicators/educational-attainment)

This measure reports the proportion of residents in the Chicago region who are age 25 and older holding an associate’s degree or higher. Higher levels of educational attainment create benefits for both individuals and regional economies. As residents receive additional postsecondary education, they can generally expect increased median earnings and a decreased likelihood of joblessness. On a regional scale, these trends translate to lower unemployment rates and greater economic output. The inclusion of associate’s degrees in this measure helps to highlight the important role community colleges play in improving education and workforce development, and reflects the significance of “middle-skill” jobs in our regional economy.

# [Educational Attainment by Race and Ethnicity](https://www.cmap.illinois.gov/2050/indicators/educational-attainment#IGperspective)

As a kindred indicator, ON TO 2050 will also track the proportion of residents in the Chicago region who are age 25 and older holding an associate’s degree or higher by race and ethnicity. Disparate outcomes exist across races and ethnicities in educational attainment. Black and Hispanic residents have educational attainment rates lower than the regional average and significantly lower than Asian and White residents.
