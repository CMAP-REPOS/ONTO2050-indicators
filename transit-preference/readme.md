# [Miles of Roadway with Transit Preference](https://www.cmap.illinois.gov/2050/indicators/transit-preference)

This indicator tracks the allocation of road space to buses. Providing extra space or right of way to buses improves travel time and reliability. This takes many forms throughout the region. Bus on shoulder and flex lanes allow buses on expressways to bypass slower traffic. Dedicated bus lanes, such as the Loop Link project, provided bus priority on local streets all day. Some bus lanes are shared with only bikes. Peak hour lanes provide a dedicated lane for buses when demand is highest and are otherwise used for parking or general travel. The region has one busway, the McCormick Busway, which provides a dedicated road for buses serving special events.
