# [Manufacturing exports](https://www.cmap.illinois.gov/2050/indicators/manufacturing-exports)

This measure tracks the total value of manufactured goods exported from the region. Historically, manufacturing has been a key driver of economic growth in the region and this kindred indicator, and this indicator reflects the planâ€™s call for organizing regional economic development around its industry clusters. The export of goods connects metropolitan economies like the Chicago region with a growing global consumer base. Exports have played an important role in past economic recoveries for both Chicago and peer metropolitan economies.
