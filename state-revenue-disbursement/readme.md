# [Municipalities with Per Capita State Revenue Disbursement Below 80 Percent of Regional Median](https://www.cmap.illinois.gov/2050/indicators/state-revenue-disbursement)

Municipalities with strong revenue levels relative to public service needs may be better able to maintain their fiscal condition and serve their residents and businesses. This may also lead to greater capacity to achieve local and regional goals. This indicator will track per capita state revenue disbursements to municipalities in northeastern Illinois, relative to the regional median. Illinois municipalities receive revenue through state disbursements of several revenue sources, including income, use, sales, motor fuel, and personal property replacement tax revenue.source material reference number. These revenues may be based on current land use, population, or similar factors, but some disbursements are based on long established criteria that may no longer relate to service and infrastructure needs or current conditions in a given community.

The amount of revenue municipalities collect varies throughout the region and depends on local land use mix, the composition of their tax structures, and the level of service the community desires from the municipality. State statutory criteria for revenue disbursements to municipalities also drive divergences, as the criteria do not always relate to the level of public services required or to a municipalityâ€™s capacity to raise its own revenue from its own tax base.
